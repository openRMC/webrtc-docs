== WebRTC Markets ==
With Google having open sourced the technology once provided by GIPS, the VoIP industry have been left without a service level agreement.Traditional VoIP companies will now have to find alternatives to SLA in order to protect their investments.
 

In-house development, either using new code, or by employing WebRTC’s source code
Switch to another vendor
Use their current investment and rely on  a third party to provide maintenance and support for it
If you are good at real time media processing, then it might be a good idea to get hold of WebRTC, which is an open source project with a permissive license, and offer such services to these kinds of companies.

WebRTC porting
WebRTC is running on multiple browser already. It will run in the future on smartphones – hopefully.

But what about the rest of the products out there? Embedded systems, iOS and the rest of the world? Small IT shops who are smart enough can take WebRTC and offer porting services for it for customers – with or without the browser wrapper that it has.

WebRTC server hosting
WebRTC is a technology that gets embedded into a web browser, but in order to run it requires several server side components – STUN and TURN servers to route and relay media as well as signaling components that reside on the server side.

A nice business can be made by offering server hosting for the media part and even the signaling or offering those as packages that others can install and manage on their own over the web.

These are going to be necessary to build solutions using WebRTC.

WebRTC consulting
WebRTC is new. It requires adaptation form existing voice and video companies and it opens the door to virtually anyone to develop a video calling system. The only problem is that knowledge about it is lacking.

There is a lot of business to be made out of WebRTC consulting – teaching companies what they can do with WebRTC and offering architectural advice on how to use it.

That’s it – 4 new business opportunities. If you are running a small IT shop, you should consider them. If you are thinking of leveraging WebRTC, then why not find the small IT shops that can assist you in the process?
