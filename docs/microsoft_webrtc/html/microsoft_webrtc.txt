== Microsoft and WebRTC ==
Microsoft Internet Explorer. At the IEFT meeting 83 in Paris Microsoft  indicated interest in supporting WebRTC in their IE browser--most probably in order to support Skype, as Skype are already using the Vp8 video codec which is the chossen standard codec for WebRTC. WebRTC is not expexted in the IE browser until sometime in 2013. 

Microsoft's previous job listings noted the need for developers with experience of HTML5 user interfaces and specifically mentioned "Skype for browsers." WebRTC is noteworthy as Google open sourced the framework in early 2011, providing video and voice chat in browsers without the need for additional plugins. The W3C is still drafting the WebRTC HTML5 standard, but Microsoft has started to work on implementing the API. Microsoft is refusing to comment "on future product or technology plans," but the company confirmed to Gigaom that it experiments with "standards based and proprietary technologies."http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/27/3120273/skype-for-browsers-webrtc-job-listing-rumor[The Verge.com]
