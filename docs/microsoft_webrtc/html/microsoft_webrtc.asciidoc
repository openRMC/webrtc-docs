== MOZILLA/FIREFOX AND WEBRTC == 

Mozilla attended IETF 83 in Paris 2012, and showed a demonstration of a simple video call between two Browser ID-authenticated parties in a prototype build of Firefox with WebRTC support.  

Mozilla have also been experimenting with integrating social features in the browser from their Persona social media product and  combining it with WebRTC to establish a video call between two users who are signed in using Browser   The Social API add-on, once installed, provides a sidebar where web content from the social service provider is rendered.       http://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/04/webrtc-efforts-underway-at-mozilla/ [Mozilla/demo]

In early 2012 Mozilla had stated they were going to adapt the VP8 video code. At present some confusion reigns. Mozilla conscious of the fact that most smart phones and tablets run the H.264 codec, have started looking at using that codec and offering the VP8 codec a separate alternative.

Mozilla are aiming to have real time communication available in Firefox last quarter 2012.
