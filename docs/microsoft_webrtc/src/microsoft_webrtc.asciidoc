== MICROSOFT AND WEBRTC == 
At the IEFT meeting 83 in Paris Microsoft indicated interest in supporting WebRTC in their IE browser most probably in order to support Skype, as Skype are already using the VP8 video codec, which looks likely to be the chosen standard video codec for WebRTC. WebRTC was not expected in the IE browser until sometime in 2013. However in June of this year Microsoft posted a job on their website looking for developers to develop WebRTC in Internet Explorer. With this development it now looks as if Microsoft will join the other browser companies in launching WebRTC late 2012.
