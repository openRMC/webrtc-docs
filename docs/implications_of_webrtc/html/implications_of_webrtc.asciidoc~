== THE IMPLICATIONS AND BENEFITS OF WEBRTC ==


* You will organise your phone calls (audio visual) using your preferred social media application or your office suite.

* The PSTN line is only used if one caller/calle is not connected to the web, or if the internet signal is too low.

* Your company's website now becomes its call centre. 

* Your weblog becomes your personal communications assistant.

* You donâ€™t require an operator anymore; you just need to be connected to the internet.

* Contacting anyone or anybody becomes a one touch, simple process.

* The ability to communicate becomes embedded in your email, your webpage, your TV, games device, apps and much more.

* Your phone number is no longer necessary anymore. It's from past technology.  

* All OTT communication can be used anywhere or on any smart device

* Any web developer can create new communication services for their clients.

* Advertising enters a whole new world of opportunities.

* Call a friend using a social media API. From the chat/online window you can click on a friend and start a video call with them in the browser.  

* Video conferencing / sharing files from inside an app. The user calls someone from inside an app and is able to share files   -- through the peer to peer connection as they are talking via the data channel.

* Games that integrate video, audio and data sharing. A game where you see the video and hear the audio of your opponent and play the game live using WebRTC data channels.

* Apps that can draw down your contacts from say your LinkedIn account; you can instantly have an audio visual meeting without leaving your office.

* Call centres where you can have a full interactive conversation with sound and video. For example a Sky service call, they can not only talk you through the process, they can watch you do it and give you guidance
