Audio  
-------
The WebRTC project offers a complete stack for voice communications. It includes not only the necessary codecs, but other
components crucial for a great experience. This includes software based acoustic echo cancellation (AEC), automatic gain control (AGC), noise reduction, noise suppression and hardware access and control across multiple platforms. There are audio codec standrds set by the WebRTC working group charter. They are the iLBC and the iSAC audio codecs,both developed by Global IP Solutions. Global IP Solutions was purchased by Google in 2010.Since then Google have provided the audio codecs royalty free. http://www.webrtc.org/ilbc-freeware/ilbc-extra-documentation[webrtc.org]

The iSAC audio codec
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
iSAC is a robust, bandwidth adaptive, wideband and super-wideband voice codec developed by Global IP Solutions used in many Voice over IP VoIP and streaming audio applications. iSAC is used by industry leaders in hundreds of millions of VoIP endpoints. This codec is included as part of the WebRTC project.https://sites.google.com/site/webrtc/faq#TOC-What-are-the-parameters-of-iSAC-[webrtc.org]

Features

* The sampling frequency is 16kHz (wideband) or 32 kHz (super wideband).
* Adaptive and variable bit rate is 10 kbit/s to 52 kbit/s
* Adaptive packet size is 30 to 60ms.
* Complexity comparable to G.722.2 at comparable bit-rates and algorithmic delay of frame size plus 3ms. 
		

The iLBC audio codec
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
iLBC is a free narrowband voice codec that was developed by Global IP Solutions used in many Voice over IP VoIP and streaming audio applications. In 2004, the final IETF RFC versions of the iLBC codec spec and the iLBC RTP Profile draft became available.Â This codec is included as part of the WebRTC project.https://sites.google.com/site/webrtc/faq#TOC-What-are-the-parameters-of-iSAC-[webrtc.org] 

Features

* Bitrate 13.33 kbps (399 bits, packetized in 50 bytes) for the frame size of 30 ms and 15.2 kbps (303 bits, packetized in 38 bytes) for the frame size of 20 ms
* Basic quality higher then G.729A, high robustness to packet loss
* Computational complexity in a range of G.729A
* Google is not charging royalties for iLBC
