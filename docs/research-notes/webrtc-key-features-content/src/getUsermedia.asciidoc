A media stream represents a media source, containing one or more synchronized media stream tracks.It can be converted to an object URL and passed to a <video> element. You use the getUser media API to get a media stream for the web cam and microphone. The user is then prompted to allow their consent, an example of this can be seen in Opera 12 where a text box drops down and requests permission from the user to allow use of their camera.

Some examples of using the getUser media. The photo booth app allows you take a photograph of the video image and add different effects to it. This app is great fun for the consumer but commercially it can be used for a multitude of reasons. You could be looking to by a car, the callee can be showing you the car live using his smart phone and you can take snapshots of say the engine number or some damage that might require a quote to repair. This is only the tip of the iceberg.

Another example is face recognition. We could do away with passwords for on-line banking, social media sites, on-line shopping or any interaction which requires a password to gain access to an account. These are only two examples of using getUsermedia, we can expect to see the number of these apps multiply daily.
