== Current innovators ==

* Asterisk/Digium (Open Source PBX) is free, open source software that makes it simple to create and deploy a wide range of telephony applications and services. They are adding WebRTC to the Asterisk project which means that with a software update to your Asterisk PBX, your smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktops can become endpoints for all your PBX features and services.

* Bistri (Social Video): Video chat with fun video effects, take screenshots of calls, share them with friends or social networks. Bistri runs in the browser, so there's no need to install additional software or plugins.http://bistri.com/[Bistri] 

* frisB (Free global calling) provides free global calling between any web browser and any phone (or web browser) with no downloads. Simply type in the number you want to call from the frisB screen in a browser that implements WebRTC--the service then calls your contact but does not connect, so a local number is available to call back in the contact's phone call history. The contact then calls back this local number; for the initial use case, the contact needs to know it's you that's calling using frisB. The frisB service then takes the contact's local call and directly connects it to you on the browser (wherever you may be in the world). It's a two-step connection process between a browser and a phone, but does work with any phone on the planet.http://www.frisb.com/[frisB]

* Tenhands (Enterprise HD Video Collaboration) is a desktop HD video collaboration service, it's free and built for business needs. They're in the process of adding WebRTC to their service, so using their service does not require any download to a browser.https://www.tenhands.net/Home.htm[Tenhands]

* Utribo (Software as a Service): "Connect" by Utribo is a service that enables subscribers to receive calls made in a web browser to their computer, phone, or PBX. Based on WebRTC, "Connect" provides voice and video calling capabilities.http://www.utribo.com/our-service/[Utribo]

* Voxeo Labs (Open source enabler for WebRTC services): Voxeo's Phono is a jQuery plug-in that turns any Web browser into a multichannel communications platform, capable of placing and receiving VoIP telephone calls from the browser, as well as handling real-time chat communications. jQuery is a cross-browser JavaScript library, so developers can do more and code less. Phono is a client-side solution and requires zero server-side logic on the part of a developer; all communication is handled by the Voxeo Cloud. Using the Phono plug-in, applications such as Your Second Phone have been created and are available in the Chrome Web Store.http://voxeolabs.com/[Voxeo Labs]

* Vox.io is a simple service that lets you make voice and video calls straight from your browser. No downloads, installations or firewall configurations are required. Vox.io also offers chat (with in-line media, so your shared content loads right beside your conversation), history, SMS, and call options like Quick Call and Group Call. Previously they required a Flash plug-in to run from a web browser, but with WebRTC no download is required. They're available in the Chrome Web Store.http://vox.io/[Vox.io]

* Zingaya ("Call" button for websites) enables voice calls through any computer from a webpage. No download or phone is required. Zingaya offers this seamless voice calling capability to any website, whether it's a large e-commerce enterprise or a start-up. Simply embed a "Call" button into the website. Visitors can click that button and the call is forwarded to the website operator's preferred land-line or mobile phone. All that is required is a website; all the visitors need is a browser and microphone.http://zingaya.com/[Zingaya]
