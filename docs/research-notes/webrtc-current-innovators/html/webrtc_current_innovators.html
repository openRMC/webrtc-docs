frisB (Free global calling) provides free global calling between any web browser and any phone (or web browser) with no downloads. Simply type in the number you want to call from the frisB screen in a browser that implements WebRTC—the service then calls your contact but does not connect, so a local number is available to call back in the contact’s phone call history. The contact then calls back this local number; for the initial use case, the contact needs to know it’s you that’s calling using frisB. The frisB service then takes the contact’s local call and directly connects it to you on the browser (wherever you may be in the world). It’s a two-step connection process between a browser and a phone, but does work with any phone on the planet.<a class="ulink" href="http://www.frisb.com/" target="_top">frisB</a>
