The http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/getusermedia.html#local-content[getUserMedia API]
is used to access media streams from media input devices such as webcams 
or microphones. The stream obtained can then either be used locally by passing it to 
a HTML +<audio/>+ or +<video/>+ tag, lending itself to many creative and 
fun applications such as photobooth, facial recognition, image processing
etc. Additionally it can be attached to an RTCPeerConnection object and 
used to establish communications with another user. Figure 1 shows possible
usage scenarios.

As an overview, +getUserMedia()+ is called with up to three parameters:

* _mediaConstraints_ - this is an object specifying the type and optionally
the quality of the media streams required. Full details can be found in the
http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/getusermedia.html#idl-def-MediaStreamConstraints[getUserMedia API]
but for the purposes of this post we'll concentrate on the boolean attributes
_audio_, and _video_, which specify whether audio and/or video streams are
required respectively.
* _successCallback_ (optional) - this is called with the 
http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/getusermedia.html#mediastream[MediaStream]. 
This is illustrated in figure 2.
object encapsulating  the media streams requested by the developer
* _errorCallback_ (optional) - this is called with an 
http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/getusermedia.html#navigatorusermediaerror-and-navigatorusermediaerrorcallback[error] 
object, which should give an indication as to why the call failed

Altough the callbacks are optional in the spec, in practice at the very
least the _successCallback_ is required, as this is the only way to access
the MediaStream object. As we shall see, providing the error callback is 
also beneficial
