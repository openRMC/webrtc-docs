+getUserMedia()+ as specified in <<gum>> is somewhat limited in the diagnostics
that are given to the user in the event of an error occurring. In an 
experiment <<gum-status>> we mapped the results of calling +getUserMedia()+ 
requesting various combinations of media against the presence or otherwise
of the relevant input devices.

This is further complicated by the cross browser differences in the type
and structure of errors returned (at the time of writing neither Chrome 
nor Firefox conform to the W3C specification of +NavigatorUserMediaError+
as laid out in <<gum>>. And that's even before considering browsers which
don't support +getUserMedia()+ in the first place.

The goal of this task is to provide better, uniform, diagnostics for the
application developer, so they can better provide feedback to the user.
