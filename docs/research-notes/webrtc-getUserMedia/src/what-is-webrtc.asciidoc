https://sites.google.com/site/webrtc/[WebRTC] is an open framework to 
enable real time communications via the web. The primary usage scenario 
would browser based, where a Javascript API allows developers to 
implement their own RTC enabled webapp. Alternatively, various toolkits exist to
facilitate native app development.

Standardisation is an ongoing process through the W3C 
http://www.w3.org/2011/04/webrtc/[WebRTC working group] at the API level
and the IETF http://tools.ietf.org/wg/rtcweb/[RTCWeb working group] at the 
protocol level.

As a very high-level overview, there are three main API components in the WebRTC 
framework:

* *getUserMedia* - provides access to media input devices such as webcams
and microphones
* *RTCPeerConnection* - establishes a peer-to-peer media session between two 
endpoints, including any relaying necessary, allowing two users to 
communicate directly
* *RTCDataConnection* - closely related to and dependent upon 
RTCPeerConnection, RTCDataChannel allows a web application to send and 
receive generic application data peer to peer

In this post we'll be looking more closely at the getUserMedia() API, and 
how to deal with its outputs in order to give some meaningful feedback to the 
developer, and ultimatly the end user.
