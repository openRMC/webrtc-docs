It's important to give the end user an informative message when things go wrong when initialising a WebRTC session and hopefully you can see that this approach along with the code snippets gives a developer the possiblity to derive a better picture of the WebRTC media capabilities of the host browser. 

The results here should be taken as a snapshot reflecting the state of play
for +getUserMedia()+ at the time of writing. As can be seen above, the API is
still fluid, and could change several times before being set in stone. It is 
also possible that Microsoft and Apple will come to the party and add support
of some sort to Internet Explorer and Safari, which will change the picture 
again.

The snippets presented in the post should therefore be taken as what they are -
an illustration. The code on https://github.com/openRMC/webrtc-context[GitHub WebRTC Context] and the 
http://www.openrmc.org/files/webrtc/context/index.html[sample app] should be kept up to date though,
and should therefore be taken as the reference.

The code presented here is also reasonably simplified, as it doesn't take into 
account the more complex forms of _mediaConstraints_ that can be passed to 
+getUserMedia()+. Adapting the code to take account of those should be quite 
straightforward however, and for the purposes of example simpler is often 
better.
