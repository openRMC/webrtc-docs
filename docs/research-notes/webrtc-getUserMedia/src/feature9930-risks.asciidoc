The primary risk at the time of writing is a combination of lack of 
cross-browser consistency in terms of the native errors returned by calls to
+getUserMedia()+. As the spec is evolving, the browser implementations will 
also evolve, and this required tracking.

A further complications is lack of support for +getAudioTracks()+ and 
+getVideoTracks()+ is streams returned by +getUserMedia()+. Chrome supports
these calls, and behaves as per the spec. Firefox however as of version 22
does not. The are present and correct in Firefox 23 and behave similarly to
Chrome, but in any earlier Firefox version, there is simply no way for 
an application to access the media streams. This is considered a low risk
as Firefox 23 is due to move to "RELEASE" status on 6/8/2013
