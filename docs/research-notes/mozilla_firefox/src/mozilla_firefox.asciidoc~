== Mozilla/Firefox and WebRTC ==
Mozilla Firefox has started showing off WebRTC support in their browser. Nothing stable enough to be able to release it in their main branch of the browser, but this is a positive step as developers can test in multiple browsers.

Mozilla attended IETF 83 in Paris, and  showed an early http://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/04/webrtc-efforts-underway-at-mozilla/[demo] of a simple video call between two BrowserID-authenticated parties in a special build of Firefox with WebRTC support.  

Mozilla have been experimenting with integrating social features in the browser, to combine it with WebRTC to establish a video call between two users who are signed in using BrowserID (now called Persona). The SocialAPI add-on, once installed, provides a sidebar where web content from the social service provider is rendered. In the  demo social service, you can see a  “buddy list” of people who are currently signed in usinghttp://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/[Persona].http://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/04/webrtc-efforts-underway-at-mozilla/[Mozilla.org]
