=== Apple/Safari and WebRTC ===
 
At present Apple have no part in the implementation or development of WebRTC in their Safari web browser, as they have vested interest in their FaceTime walled garden of audio/visual communication and in the H.264 audio codec, which isn't part of WebRTC at present.

However WebRTC4all built by the Google development team is an extension for Safari and other browsers. This allows developers to add the WebRTC functions such as audio/video streaming in all browsers now and they will easily be able to switch to the official implementation when it's added by Apple and others.
