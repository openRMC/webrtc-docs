Web Real-Time Communications Working Group Charter (Formed 2011)

The mission of the Web Real-Time Communications Working Group, part of the Ubiquitous Web Applications Activity, is to define client-side APIs to enable Real-Time Communications in Web browsers.
These APIs should enable building applications that can be run inside a browser, requiring no extra downloads or plugins, that allow communication between parties using audio, video and supplementary real-time communication, without having to use intervening servers (unless needed for firewall traversal, or for providing intermediary services)

The working groups scope is enabling real-time communications between Web browsers require the following client-side technologies to be available:

* API functions to explore device capabilities, e.g. camera, microphone, speakers (currently in scope for the Device APIs & Policy Working Group) 
* API functions to capture media from local devices (camera and microphone) (currently in scope for the Device APIs & Policy Working Group) 
* API functions for encoding and other processing of those media streams, 
* API functions for establishing direct peer-to-peer connections, including firewall/NAT traversal 
* API functions for decoding and processing (including echo cancelling, stream synchronization and a number of other functions) of those streams at the incoming end, 
* Delivery to the user of those media streams via local screens and audio output devices (partially covered with HTML5) 

The working group will not be looking at the protocols for WebRTC, this will the domain of  IETF.http://www.w3.org/2011/04/webrtc-charter.html[W3C]
